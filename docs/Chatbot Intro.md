# Introduction to Chatbot using Intent Classifier and BERT

I built a chatbot using an intent classifier as first level of identification and BERT to give final answers. The chatbot will be able to understand and respond to user queries related to various scientific topics.

## Intent Classification

Intent classification is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to identify the intention behind a user's input. In our chatbot, we will use an intent classifier to categorize user queries into different intents related to sciences.

## BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

BERT is a state-of-the-art pre-trained language model developed by Google. It has achieved remarkable performance in various NLP tasks, including intent classification. We will leverage BERT's powerful language understanding capabilities to enhance our chatbot's accuracy and performance.

## Zeroing in on Topics

To provide more accurate responses, our chatbot will analyze the user's query and zero in on the specific scientific topics from which the question is asked. This will allow the chatbot to provide more relevant and targeted answers.
